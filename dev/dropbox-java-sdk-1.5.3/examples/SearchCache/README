This directory includes an example command-line program that uses the /delta API
call to maintain a local cache of your Dropbox's file names.

Before you can run this example, you'll need a Dropbox App Folder application, along
with its key and secret.  You can get one at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

To compile:  ./compile
To run:      ./run

-------------------
Example usage:

0. Compile the program
   > ./compile

1. Link to your Dropbox account
   > ./run link <app-key> <app-secret>

2. Go to Dropbox and make changes to the contents of the App Folder.

3. Update the local cache to match what's on Dropbox.
   > ./run update

4. Search the local cache.
   > ./run find 'txt'

Repeat steps 2-4 any number of times.
