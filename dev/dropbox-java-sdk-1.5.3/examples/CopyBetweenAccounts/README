This directory includes an example command-line program that uses the /sharing_token
API to copy files between different Dropbox accounts.
call to maintain a local cache of your Dropbox's file names.

Before you can run this example, you'll need a Dropbox application key.
You can create one at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

To compile:  ./compile
To run:      ./run

-------------------
Example usage:

0. Compile the program
   > ./compile

1. Reset the state, tell the program to use the given app key and secret.
   > ./run reset <app-key> <app-secret>

2. Link to a Dropbox account (do this at least twice, with two different accounts)
   > ./run link

3. List the accounts that are linked, remember the UIDs
   > ./run list

4. Update the local cache to match what's on Dropbox.
   > ./run <uid>:/path/to/source/file <uid>:/path/to/target/file
