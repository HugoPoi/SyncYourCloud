Getting started with the Dropbox Java SDK:
1. Include everything under lib/ in your project/build.
2. You'll probably want to start off by creating a WebAuthSession with your
   consumer key and secret, which will authenticate users through the Dropbox
   web site.
3. Create a DropboxAPI object with your session.
4. Start developing the rest of your Dropbox API application!
